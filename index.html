<h4> Supporting Open-Source Devs </h4>
<p> Redheads is proud to support and sponsor the devs that make and maintain the tools we use to run our studio, make our games, and maintain the technology we rely on.
We plan to be completely transparent about where we donate to, and how much we donate. As of July 2024, Redheads doesn't depend on any repositories whose maintainers can be sponsored. We expect this to change as we continue to grow and incorporate more advanced technology. </p>

<p> For now, we encourage all of our fans and interested parties reading this to consider what technology <b>you</b> rely on everyday. The internet relies on Open-Source Projects to exist, most of which are lovingly maintained by single developers for decades, most often for nothing in return. </p>

<p> Are you ready to support the people that make the internet special? <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/explore/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Read more about Sponsoring Open Source Developers here. </a> </p>
